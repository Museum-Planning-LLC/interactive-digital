# Interactive Digital

**Museum Planning LLC** · delivery repository

Repository of **Interactive Digital** museum experiences — standalone kiosk, full-wall immersive, and full-room immersive — built for participatory use: institution content as material, not a single authored verdict.

This repo is **downstream of planning**, not a product sold cold. It supports the [Museum & Cultural Resiliency Planning Study](https://museumplanning.com/museum-cultural-resiliency-planning.html): when a **Modular Implementation Menu** item funds digital work in a repositioned or reactivated gallery, implementations are scoped and built from this library.

## Form factors

| Factor | Typical use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Kiosk** | Single-station, touch or simple presence; high throughput, lower capital |
| **Full-wall immersive** | One or more large surfaces; narrative or simulation at architectural scale |
| **Full-room immersive** | Projection or display on multiple surfaces; spatial sensing; social geometry |

See [docs/form-factors.md](./docs/form-factors.md).

## Catalog — four templates (90-day internal flush)

Reference patterns for menu-funded work. **Not sold cold. Not shown publicly during flush.**

| # | Entry | Domain | Form factor | Status |

| 2 | [Flow field grid](./catalog/flow-field-grid.md) | Science | Full-wall / kiosk | [Live proof on museumplanning.com](https://museumplanning.com/interactive-digital/flow-field-grid.html) |
